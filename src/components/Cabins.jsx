            LÃ¸vtags three exclusive and comfortable cabins, Et, Ro and Ly, are
            designed by architect Sigurd Larsen. They all have an open space
            with a double bed, a double sofa bed, kitchen, separate toilet and
            an outdoor shower. On the roof, surrounded by treetops, there is a
            terrace, which is about nine meters above ground. The cottages are
            built around tall, old trees that go through the entire cottage from
            floor to ceiling.
