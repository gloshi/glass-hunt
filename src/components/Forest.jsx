          LÃ¸vtags three exclusive and comfortable cabins, Et, Ro and Ly, are
          designed by architect Sigurd Larsen. They all have an open space with
          a double bed, a double sofa bed, kitchen, separate toilet and an
          outdoor shower. On the roof, surrounded by treetops, there is a
          terrace, which is about nine meters above ground. The cottages are
          built around tall, old trees that go through the entire cottage from
          floor to ceiling.
